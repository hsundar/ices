Research
========

Here are brief descriptions of my current areas of research. A selected list of publications is available [here](/~hari/work/pubs) and a complete list can be found on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=equOxc0AAAAJ).

Octrees
=======

My dissertation research on algorithms for constructing and balancing octrees in parallel. Algorithms for fast meshing based on octrees from points and image data were also developed. The mesh is used for solving PDEs on using the finite element method. This work has been extended to include multigrid solvers and is [freely available](/~hari/code/). The work has also been extended to include complex geometries as a forest of octrees ([p4est](http://www.p4est.org/)).

Multigrid
=========
<img class='inset top' src='/~hari/images/multigrid.png' title='Grid Hierarchy' alt='Grid hierarchy' width='480px' />

My current research involved developing parallel geometric multigrid (GMG) methods for solving variable-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on arbitrary geometries using highly unstructured forests of octrees. We use algebraic multigrid (AMG) as the coarse grid solver for GMG, giving us ability to adjust the number of GMG and AMG levels based on the application. Numerical experiments for the 3D variable-coefficient Poisson problem demonstrate the scalability of our method and our largest run was a highly non-uniform mesh of the earth's mantle, with 80-Billion unknowns using 262,144 cores on NCCS's Jaguar. I am currently working on extending this to support **higher-order** discretizations.

Sorting
=======

Although comparison-based sorting is a well studied subject, there are practical issues related to its scalability at large core counts. Specifically scalability of existing approaches deteriorates as the number of processes becomes larger than the average number of records on a process. Sorting is also an enabling algorithm for parallelization as several problems can be addressed by using an efficient parallel sort as a building block. An example of this is the previously mentioned octree construction and 2:1 balance refinement, both of which can be implemented as process-local operations and distributed sorts. In [ICS-13](/~hari/files/pubs/ics13.pdf), we presented a new in-RAM sorting algorithm, HykSort, where we sustained an in-RAM sort throughput of 54TB/min on 262,144 cores of the CRAY XK7 \emph{Titan} platform at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Such a high throughput was achieved by avoiding $\mathcal{O}(p)$-collective communication primitives, ensuring better load balancing and using a staged-communication pattern to avoid network congestion. Given the rate at which data has been growing, the imbalance between what we can fit in memory, and the amount of data we wish to process is only going to increase for the foreseeable future. In [SC13](/~hari/files/pubs/sc13.pdf), we extended our algorithm to perform out-of-core sorting. By clever use of available storage and a formulation of asynchronous data transfer mechanisms, we are able to almost completely hide the computation (sorting) behind the IO latency. This latency hiding enables us to achieve comparable execution times, including the additional temporary IO required, between a large sort problem (5TB) run as a single, in-RAM sort and our out-of-core approach using 1/10th the amount of RAM. In our largest run, sorting 100TB of records using 1792 hosts, we achieved an end-to-end throughput of 1.24TB/min using our general-purpose sorter, improving on the current Daytona record holder by 65\%. We demonstrated sustained throughput on three of the fastest supercomputers in the world --- **Titan** at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, **Stampede** at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and **Blue Waters** at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As the developed out-of-core method tests and stresses nearly all components of modern supercomputing architectures (global IO, local IO, interconnect, local compute performance, etc) we also plan to package the entire process (data delivery plus sort) for use as a standalone, system-level benchmark.

Graph Algos
===========
<img class='inset top' src='/~hari/images/dewall.png' title='Grid Hierarchy' alt='Grid hierarchy' width='480px'/>

__Relative Neighborhood Graphs__ We present a parallel algorithm for computing cycle orders and cycle perimeters in relative neighborhood graphs (Urquhart approximations) derived from histopathological image data. This algorithm would enable the study of correlations between macroscopic imaging biomarkers of prostate cancer and these important graph-theoretic microscopic biomarkers and may also allow the rapid automated Gleason scoring or cancer detection in prostate biopsy slides. Our algorithm consists of the following steps: (1) Uniform partitioning of the nuclei across processes, (2) Parallel Delaunay triangulation and (3) Parallel computation of the the RNG and the cycle orders and perimeters. We have evaluated our algorithm on a whole-mount histopathology slide obtained after radical prostatectomy. The single-process sequential version of our parallel algorithm offers a significant speed-up over a straightforward sequential algorithm and we demonstrate excellent fixed-size and isogranular parallel scalabity upto 384 processes.

__Graph Coloring__ is a form of graph labeling, wherein we wish to label(color) vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. It is of interest to my research due to its use in parallelization of algorithms such as the [Gau√ü-Seidel method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method).
I have a simple 2D [javascript demo](/~hari/code/coloring) exploring coloring issues on quadtrees.

Biomechanics
============

My dissertation research involved the development of a method for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance (MR) cardiac images with the goal of reconstructing the motion of the myocardial tissue. The main feature of our method is that the inversion parameter field is the active contraction of the myocardial fibers. This is accomplished with a biophysically-constrained, four-dimensional (space plus time) formulation that aims to complement information that can be gathered from the images by _a priori_ knowledge of cardiac mechanics and electrophysiology. Incorporating biomechanical priors introduces major computational challenges, which constitute the main issue tackled by my dissertation research.

Our main hypothesis is that by incorporating biophysical information, we can generate more informative priors and thus, more accurate predictions of the ventricular wall motion. In this thesis, we outline the formulation, discuss the computational methodology for solving the inverse motion estimation, and present results using synthetic and tagged MR data. We also present methods for generating and solving using a spatially non-uniform octree meshing scheme with an adjoint-based inversion solver. The overall method uses patient-specific MR data and fiber information to reconstruct the motion. Additional information is available on my [biomechanics](/~hari/work/biomech) page.
